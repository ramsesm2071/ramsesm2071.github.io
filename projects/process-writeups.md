# Process Writeup

## Name: Ramses M
## Course: Applied Visual Design (Colors)
## Period: 8
## Concept: Learning how to use colors 

## Context

In this course we learned how to use colors to make different things like gradients, linear gradients, repeating gradients, and complementary colors. We also saw other groups projects which showed us different things like animation, basics, positioning, and geometry. Some color concepts I learned while doing this course are:
* Using hex code. Ex:  red (#FF0000) blue (#0000FF)
* Using teritary colors Ex: orange(#FF7F00) (Teritary Colors is combining a primary color with a secondary color, in this example we use red and yellow.)
* Adjusting the hue of a color. Ex: blue	hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
* Learning how to create a background gradient. Ex:  background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

[My Group's Project.](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm3ndtjm795d047v5s1701a8f)

(Example of the code to making a linear gradient)

```language
body {
background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));
}
```

Other groups showed us other things like:
## Basics
* `text-align: justify;` spaces the text so that each line has equal width
* `text-align: center;` centers the text
* `text-align: right;` right-aligns the text
* `text-align: left;` (The Default) left-aligns the text

## Positioning
* `Position relative;` Moves the element without affecting other elements
* `Position absolute;` Locks the element to its closest ancestor
* `Position fixed;` Locks the element in place
* `Float left;` Moves element to position itself left
* `Float right;` Moves element to position itself right

## Geometry
* SkewY `transform: skewX (-15deg)`
* SkewX `transform: skewY (-15deg)`
* Scale  `transform: scale (1) or (2) or (3) and so on`
  
## Animation
* `animation-name:` Labels an element
* `animation-duration:` How long the element plays for 
* `img: hover` Plays the animation when you hover the img
* `button: hover` Plays the animation when you hover the button

## Challenges

One Challenge I had was taking notes as the different groups presented and I couldn't keep up so I wasn't able to get many notes by the end of the day. But fortunately every groups pickcode was shared so we could go back and take notes whenever we wanted so when I got home I made sure to take more notes to fully understand mine, and other's projects.

Another Challenge I had was that I felt like I wasn't doing much for my group as I didn't do as much work as the others as well as I didn't present as much as the others. To solve this I communicated my problem with my groupmates and I was able to get some more work and more to present which helped a lot as I didn't fully understand the colors concept, so asking to do more work helped teach me how to fully utilize colors in my coding.

## Takeaways

One takeaway is to communicate and collabarate with your partners, I did this by communicating my problems with my teammates, as well as suggestions I had. By doing this I was able to take on more work and presentations, this helped me understand more of the project.

Another takeaway is to use my notes as well as take notes when given the opportunity, when the pickcodes were shared it was a big opportunity to catch up on any concepts I may have not fully understood or knew nothing about. By taking notes it helps improve my grasp on the concepts shared by the different groups.
